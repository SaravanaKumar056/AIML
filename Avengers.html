    </p>The following outline serves as an overview of and topical guide to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), an American media franchise and shared universe created by Marvel Studios and owned by the Walt Disney Company. The franchise began in 2008 with the release of the film Iron Man and has since expanded to include various superhero films and television series produced by Marvel Studios, television series from Marvel Television, short films, digital series, literature, and other media. These are based on characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige produces every film and series from that studio for the MCU. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.The franchise has been commercially successful and has grossed over $30.6 billion at the global box office, becoming one of the highest-grossing media franchises and the highest-grossing film franchise of all time.[1] This includes Avengers: Endgame (2019), which concluded its theatrical run as the highest-grossing film of all time.[2] The franchise has received numerous accolades for its films and television series, and has inspired other film and television studios to attempt similar shared universes. It has also spawned the creation of several themed attractions, documentary series, literary material, and multiple tie-in video games
